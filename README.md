Making a 2D game with Lua based on The Booth

Project uses the Love2D game engine. Certain files were borrowed from the CS50 Game Development Course (provided online by Harvard). Authorship has been preserved in those reused files.

The game is based on characters from an improv show called [The Booth with Chuck & Bill](https://www.facebook.com/TheBoothImprov/). In the show, there is a running joke that Bill Block is living off of family members. In this game, you play Bill trying to collect his stuff while his mom is hunting you and trying to kick you out.
